# StudentAcademicRoster
TITLE:
Class Roster System

PURPOSE:
This project created a Class Roster that displayed the current university's students information. The contents of the system included the student's ID, first name, last name, age, days of completion for courses taken, and degree program. A code was also written to display a series of invalid emails due to spaces in the email's input or if it is missing the "@" or "." symbol. The system also parsed the input of the days of completion to average the number of days that the student is typically in their courses. Another action that the system can do is display only students in a specific degree program. The user has the ability to remove a student from the system by the student's ID and then refreshing to display the remaining students. Lastly, if the user tries to delete a non-existing student ID, an error message will be displayed.
